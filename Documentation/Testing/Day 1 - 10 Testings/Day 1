Great—let's make sure what you've built so far is working **end-to-end**, and then I'll guide you through your **first Git commits** with clear messages. You’ll:

1. ✅ Run and test the backend (Flask)
2. ✅ Run and test the frontend (React)
3. ✅ Confirm communication between them
4. ✅ Do your first commits with meaningful messages

---

## ✅ STEP A: Test the Backend (Flask)

### 1. 📦 Set up a virtual environment (in `black-styles/backend/`):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. ▶️ Run the Flask server:

```bash
python run.py
```

It should print something like:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

> **NOTE:** If you haven't added `/api/image/upload` yet, you won’t get a response from the frontend just yet, but you can confirm the Flask server runs and CORS isn’t blocking anything.

---

## ✅ STEP B: Test the Frontend (React)

### 1. 📦 Install dependencies:

Inside `black-styles/frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. ▶️ Run the React dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port it shows).

If everything is set up, your `UploadForm.jsx` should show a file input and an upload button. Console will likely show a failed upload (until we implement the backend endpoint), but React works.

## ✅ STEP C: GitHub Commits — What & Why

You want **frequent, descriptive commits** based on logical progress.

### 📂 Recommended First Commits

> You can commit from either terminal or Git panel in VS Code.

### 1. 🔧 Initialize repo + folders

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize project structure with frontend and backend folders"
```

### 2. 🖥️ Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
git add .
git commit -m "feat(frontend): set up React with Vite and basic UploadForm component"
```

### 3. ⚙️ Backend setup

```bash
cd ../backend
git add .
git commit -m "feat(backend): set up Flask app structure with placeholder services and routes"
```

### 4. 🚀 Connect both (if backend and frontend are talking)

```bash
git commit -am "feat: connect frontend upload form to Flask backend (test route)"
```

---

## ✅ Optional: Push to GitHub

Make sure you’ve created the GitHub repo already using:

```bash
gh repo create black-styles --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

Then push:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

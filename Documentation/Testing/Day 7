---

## Step 1 — Start Backend + Frontend
# Backend
cd backend
flask run

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

## Step 2 — Upload Image (Success Case)
# Via UI
1. Go to http://localhost:5173.
2. Select a valid image file (.jpg or .png).
3. Click Upload.
4. ✅ Verify:
   - Loading spinner shows.
   - After processing, 3–5 swatches appear.
   - Hex values are listed below swatches.

## Step 3 — Invalid File Upload (Error Case)
# Via UI
1. Select a .txt file instead of an image.
2. Click Upload.
3. ✅ Verify:
   - Loading spinner shows.
   - Error message appears: “Invalid file type. Please upload a JPG or PNG.”

## Step 4 — Backend Error Simulation
1. Temporarily break backend by renaming color_palette.py.
2. Restart backend.
3. Upload image via UI.
4. ✅ Verify:
   - Error message appears on UI (“Upload failed. Please try again.”)..
   - Console shows backend error log.

## Step 5 — Edge Cases
- Upload very large image → App should still return palette (after longer processing).
- Upload multiple times quickly → Only last upload result should show.
